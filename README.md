Rocket league mod that allows you to control any game variable using triggers or joystick values. (work in progress)
adds command "execCommand" to Bakkes Mod f6 console. you can type any mathematical expression containing one of these variables:
 LT
 RT
 LSUp
 LSDown
 LSLeft
 LSRight
 RSUp
 RSDown
 RSLeft
 RSRight
 LSUD (left stick up and down in one value)
 RSUD (right stick up and down in one value)
 LSLR (left stick left and right in one value)
 RSLR (right stick left and right in one value)

example for what a console command could look like (remember to put the command in quotes):
execCommand “sv_soccar_gamespeed 1-LT”
This command makes time slow down the more that the left trigger is pressed.
